# Rattleback Equations of Motion
The rattleback is commonly modelled with either a paraboloid or ellipsoidal
surface.  As such, the equations of motion for both surfaces are derived
separately in the following files

* ellipsoid_no_slip.py
* paraboloid_no_slip.py
* ellipsoid_no_slip_steady.py
* paraboloid_no_slip_steady.py

The steady versions derive the equations for the dynamic equilibrium case.
