0.5.0 (January 9, 2019)
=======================

- SymPy introduced a backward incompatibility to differentiation Matrices in
  SymPy 1.2, which remained in SymPy 1.3, see:

0.3.0 (January 19, 2015)
========================

User Facing
-----------

- Introduced conda builds and binstar support. [PR `#219`_]
- Dropped support for IPython < 3.0. [PR `#237`_]
- Added support Python 3.3 and 3.4. [PR `#229`_]
- Bumped up the minimum dependencies for NumPy, SciPy, and Cython [PR `#233`_].
- Removed the partial implementation of the Mesh shape. [PR `#172`_]
- Overhauled the code generation package to make the generators more easily
  extensible and to improve simulation speed. [PR `#113`_]
- The visualizer has been overhauled as part of Tarun Gaba's 2014 GSoC
  internship [PR `#82`_]. Here are some of the changes:

  - The JavaScript is now handled by AJAX and requires a simple server.
  - The JavaScript has been overhauled and now uses prototype.js for object
    oriented design.
  - The visualizer can now be loaded in an IPython notebook via IPython's
    widgets using ``Scene.display_ipython()``.
  - A slider was added to manually control the frame playback.
  - The visualization shapes' attributes can be manipulated via the GUI.
  - The scene json file can be edited and downloaded from the GUI.
  - pydy.viz generates two JSONs now (instead of one in earlier versions). The
    JSON generated from earlier versions will **not** work in the new version.
  - Shapes can now have a material attribute.
  - Model constants can be modified and the simulations can be rerun all via
    the GUI.
  - Switched from socket based server to python's core SimpleHTTPServer.
  - The server has a proper shutdown response [PR `#241`_]

- Added a new experimental System class and module to more seamlessly manage
  integrating the equations of motion. [PR `#81`_]
