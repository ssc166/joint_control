  abstract = {We present canonical linearized equations of motion for the Whipple
	bicycle model consisting of four rigid laterally symmetric ideally
	hinged parts: two wheels, a frame and a front assembly. The wheels
	are also axisymmetric and make ideal knife-edge rolling point contact
	with the ground level. The mass distribution and geometry are otherwise
	arbitrary. This conservative non-holonomic system has a seven-dimensional
	accessible configuration space and three velocity degrees of freedom
	parametrized by rates of frame lean, steer angle and rear wheel rotation.
	We construct the terms in the governing equations methodically for
	easy implementation. The equations are suitable for e.g. the study
	of bicycle self-stability. We derived these equations by hand in
	two ways and also checked them against two nonlinear dynamics simulations.
	In the century-old literature, several sets of equations fully agree
	with those here and several do not. Two benchmarks provide test cases
	for checking alternative formulations of the equations of motion
	or alternative numerical solutions. Further, the results here can
	also serve as a check for general purpose dynamic programs. For the
	benchmark bicycles, we accurately calculate the eigenvalues (the
	roots of the characteristic equation) and the speeds at which bicycle
	lean and steer are self-stable, confirming the century-old result
	that this conservative system can have asymptotic stability.},

  abstract = {We write nonlinear equations of motion for an idealized benchmarkbicycle
	in two different ways and verify their validity. We then present
	a complete description of hands-free circular motions. Three distinct
	families exist. (i) A handlebar-forward family, starting from capsize
	bifurcation off straight-line motion and ending in unstable static
	equilibrium, with the frame perfectly upright and the front wheel
	almost perpendicular. (ii) A handlebar-reversed family, starting
	again from capsize bifurcation but ending with the front wheel again
	steered straight, the bicycle spinning infinitely fast in small circles
	while lying flat in the ground plane. (iii) Lastly, a family joining
	a similar flat spinning motion (with handlebar forward), to a handlebar-reversed
	limit, circling in dynamic balance at infinite speed, with the frame
	near upright and the front wheel almost perpendicular; the transition
	between handlebar forward and reversed is through moderate-speed
	circular pivoting, with the rear wheel not rotating and the bicycle
	virtually upright. Small sections of two families are stable.},
